IP Address uiquely identifies a device on a network
Every device on the internet has a unique IP address 

nslookup google.com : Will give the list of IP Addresses tagged to the website

IP address is a connectionless protocol and packets are treated differently and may take different paths like :
    - Load Balancing
    - OSPF which checks the Bandwidth
    - RIP which checks the HopCount

IP Address has heirarchical structure for routing and consists of two portions:
    - Network portion:
        - Identifies a specific network
        - Routers maintain routing tables that contain the network
        - Look at destination of IP address and match to network address
    - Host portion:
        - Identifies a specific endpoint on a network
        - ex. server, printers, PCs, IPhone, IPad, etc

Devices in a network or a subnet have a unique IP address just like our house has a unique house number in a specific street

IP delivery and routing fetaures:
    - Best effort delivery
    - No data recovery features
    - No retransmissions
    - No builtin sessions

IP addresses are 32 bits in size and are typically written in dotted decimal notation

Address Classes:
    - Class A - unicast Traffic
        - First 8 bits denotes networks while the last 24 bits denotes hosts
        - Range between 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
        - so the first octet will always be 0
        - 00000000 to 01111111 or 0 till 127
        - Actually it is from 1.0.0.0 till 126.255.255.255. 127 is used for loopback and 0 is configured for the default network
    - Class B - unicast Traffic
        - First 16 bits denotes networks while the last 16 bits denotes hosts
        - Range between 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
        - First Octet Range between 10000000 to 10111111 or 128 till 191
    - Class C - unicast Traffic
        - First 24 bits are the networks while the last 8 bits are denoted as the host
        - Range between 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.255
        - First octet range between 11000000 till 11011111
    - Class D - multicast Traffic
        - Specially used by routers for speaking with other devices
        - Range between 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.2555
        - First octet range between 11100000 till 11101111
    - Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes
        - It is a reserved address for bordcasting
        - Range between 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.2555
        - First octet range between 11100000 till 11101111

Class A, B,C were replaced by Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993
 
Special Addresses:
    - Directed Broadcast Address
        - host sends data to all devices on a specific network
        - Binary 1 is populated in the entire host portion of the address
        - Example address:  172.31.255.255
        - Routers can route directed broadcast
        - By default it is disabled so as to prevent hacking and Denial of Service Attacks
    - Local Broadcast Address:
        - it is used to communicate with all devices on local network
        - looks like 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 in binary or like 255.255.255.255 in decimals
        - ex. host requesting an IP address from a DHCP server
        - always dropped by routers and can be configured by DHCP forwarding or DHCP relays (in the router) so that the DHCP server can be contacted by the router and an IP Address can be provided. Even after configuring, the router drops this local broadcast and converts this into an unicast and then sends to the DHCP server for accepting the requests and providing the response
    - Local Loopback Address:
        - it is used to let a system send a message to itself for testing
        - this is very useful to make sure that the TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on a machine
        - 127.0.0.1 or anything starting with 127. -> Loopback adddress and cannot be allocated as an IP addresses in the internet. 
        - ::1 -> for IPV6 
        - routers have loopback addresses which are not the same as the local loopback address
    - Private Address:
        - RFC1918 (RFC is request for comments) talks about pivate IP addresses and are non-routable on the internet
        - The Internet assigned numbers authority (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets
            - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) - 1 Class A Network
            - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 ( 172.16/12 prefix) - 16 Class B Networks
            - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) - 256 Class C Networks
        - NAT will tranlate one of these IP addresses to a publicly routable address when we are searching to some external website through a router
    - IPV4 Link - Local Addresses:
        - Scenario happens when a PC is setup and there is no DHCP server available
        - The PC sets up internally an IP address of 169.254.0.0/16
        - Modern computers allow two computers to communcate when there are no DHCP servers available
        - Host randomly generate the host specific part of the address (169.254..)
        - So a PC without a DHCP server can easily commuicate with an address ex. (169.254.1.1) with another PC with an address ex. (169.254.1.2)
        - Users will be able to communicate with other devices on the local segment or local link but they will not be able to connect with devices on the internet or devices on the subnet

Subnet Mask:
    - It is used to determine which part of the address is the network portion and which part of the network is the host portion
    - It allows a PC to determine that a device it wants to communicate with is a remote device or a local device
    - If two PCs are not in the same subnet, then they will forward to the default gateway, else they will interact directly
    - Two PCs for ex. 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.2.1 are in the same subnet if they are using the /16 mask. Similary if they are using the /24 mask, then they are in different subnets
    - Network mask allows us to determine the portion of address which is the host and which is the network
    - Class A,B and C networks have default masks, also known as natural masks 
        - Class A: 255.0.0.0
        - Class B: 255.255.0.0
        - Class C: 255.255.255.0
    - Two simple rules:
        - Any address bits which have corresponding mask bit set to 1 represents the network ID
        - Any address bits that have corresponding mask bits set to 0 represents the node ID
    - Modern computers and routers do not care about IP classes. They only care about the mask.
    - 1.1.1.1 (IP) and 255.255.0.0 (mask) signifies network as 1.1. and host as .1.1
    - 10.3.1.3 (IP) and 255.0.0.0 (mask) signifies network as 10 and host as 3.1.3 
    - To work out if another host is local, check the network portion of the address (through their masks) and then compare it to the other host. If they are the same, then they are local (and will send the ARP message to fetch the MAC address), else they are remote to one another (and will send the details over the default gateway)
    - Cisco devices do not support discontiguous mask   
        - 11110000.11111111.00000110.11000000=240.255.3.191
    - Only contiguous subnet masks are supported
        - 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000=255.240.0.0
        - 11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000=255.255.192.0

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR):
    - Introduced in 1993 and CIDR replaces classful IP addresses
    - Allows the usage of Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)
    - Uses notations 10.0.0.0/8 notation rather than 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
    - Mask has to be contiguous 1s as have been mentioned previously
    - 255.224.0.0 mask is same as 11111111.11100000.0000000.0000000 which is again same as /11 and the divider between the network and the host is not in the octet boundary, but somewhere in the middle.
