IP Address uiquely identifies a device on a network
Every device on the internet has a unique IP address 

nslookup google.com : Will give the list of IP Addresses tagged to the website

IP address is a connectionless protocol and packets are treated differently and may take different paths like :
    - Load Balancing
    - OSPF which checks the Bandwidth
    - RIP which checks the HopCount

IP Address has heirarchical structure for routing and consists of two portions:
    - Network portion:
        - Identifies a specific network
        - Routers maintain routing tables that contain the network
        - Look at destination of IP address and match to network address
    - Host portion:
        - Identifies a specific endpoint on a network
        - ex. server, printers, PCs, IPhone, IPad, etc

Devices in a network or a subnet have a unique IP address just like our house has a unique house number in a specific street

IP delivery and routing fetaures:
    - Best effort delivery
    - No data recovery features
    - No retransmissions
    - No builtin sessions

IP addresses are 32 bits in size and are typically written in dotted decimal notation

Address Classes:
    - Class A - unicast Traffic
        - First 8 bits denotes networks while the last 24 bits denotes hosts
        - Range between 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
        - so the first octet will always be 0
        - 00000000 to 01111111 or 0 till 127
        - Actually it is from 1.0.0.0 till 126.255.255.255. 127 is used for loopback and 0 is configured for the default network
    - Class B - unicast Traffic
        - First 16 bits denotes networks while the last 16 bits denotes hosts
        - Range between 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
        - First Octet Range between 10000000 to 10111111 or 128 till 191
    - Class C - unicast Traffic
        - First 24 bits are the networks while the last 8 bits are denoted as the host
        - Range between 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.255
        - First octet range between 11000000 till 11011111
    - Class D - multicast Traffic
        - Specially used by routers for speaking with other devices
        - Range between 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.2555
        - First octet range between 11100000 till 11101111
    - Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes
        - It is a reserved address for bordcasting
        - Range between 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.2555
        - First octet range between 11100000 till 11101111

Class A, B,C were replaced by Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993
 
Special Addresses:
    - Directed Broadcast Address
        - host sends data to all devices on a specific network
        - Binary 1 is populated in the entire host portion of the address
        - Example address:  172.31.255.255
        - Routers can route directed broadcast
        - By default it is disabled so as to prevent hacking and Denial of Service Attacks
    - Local Broadcast Address:
        - it is used to communicate with all devices on local network
        - looks like 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 in binary or like 255.255.255.255 in decimals
        - ex. host requesting an IP address from a DHCP server
        - always dropped by routers and can be configured by DHCP forwarding or DHCP relays (in the router) so that the DHCP server can be contacted by the router and an IP Address can be provided. Even after configuring, the router drops this local broadcast and converts this into an unicast and then sends to the DHCP server for accepting the requests and providing the response
    - Local Loopback Address:
        - it is used to let a system send a message to itself for testing
        - this is very useful to make sure that the TCP/IP stack is correctly installed on a machine
        - 127.0.0.1 or anything starting with 127. -> Loopback adddress and cannot be allocated as an IP addresses in the internet. 
        - ::1 -> for IPV6 
        - routers have loopback addresses which are not the same as the local loopback address
