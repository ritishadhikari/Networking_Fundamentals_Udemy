IP Address uiquely identifies a device on a network
Every device on the internet has a unique IP address 

nslookup google.com : Will give the list of IP Addresses tagged to the website

IP address is a connectionless protocol and packets are treated differently and may take different paths like :
    - Load Balancing
    - OSPF which checks the Bandwidth
    - RIP which checks the HopCount

IP Address has heirarchical structure for routing and consists of two portions:
    - Network portion:
        - Identifies a specific network
        - Routers maintain routing tables that contain the network
        - Look at destination of IP address and match to network address
    - Host portion:
        - Identifies a specific endpoint on a network
        - ex. server, printers, PCs, IPhone, IPad, etc

Devices in a network or a subnet have a unique IP address just like our house has a unique house number in a specific street

IP delivery and routing fetaures:
    - Best effort delivery
    - No data recovery features
    - No retransmissions
    - No builtin sessions

IP addresses are 32 bits in size and are typically written in dotted decimal notation

Address Classes:
    - Class A - unicast Traffic
        - First 8 bits denotes networks while the last 24 bits denotes hosts
        - Range between 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
        - so the first octet will always be 0
        - 00000000 to 01111111 or 0 till 127
        - Actually it is from 1.0.0.0 till 126.255.255.255. 127 is used for loopback and 0 is configured for the default network
    - Class B - unicast Traffic
        - First 16 bits denotes networks while the last 16 bits denotes hosts
        - Range between 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
        - First Octet Range between 10000000 to 10111111 or 128 till 191

    - Class C - unicast Traffic
    - Class D - multicast Traffic
    - Class E - reserved for future or experimental purposes

Class A, B,C were replaced by Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993
